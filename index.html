                If it isnt obvious, or if you're blind, or just have an attention span close to a golden retriver on
                speed, we just want to spell it out
                for you; South Park! This page is about South Park. And data science of course. More exactly, the
                lovechild of South Park and data science.
                We will guide you trough the process of how we got deep and dirty with the South Park data. How we
                retrived it, how we processed it and how we caressed it.
                If you manage to neglect the urge of throwing your computer trough the window, due to the direct
                boredom inflicted by methodology, you will be awarded.
                The reward is of the juicy kind, that is the data analysis kind. Exciting stuff huh?
                Like an bunch of nerdy Dr. Phils we unraveled the relations and attitude of the people in South Park.
                Therefore we're now equiped to answer the questions you always wanted to ask
                but did'nt have neither the means or the energy too do.
                Questions like who has the most influence? Is Hitler the happiest person in South Park?
                And most imortantly, what is Cartmans catchphrase?
                <br />

            <h2>Data</h2>

            <p>
                We have gathered all our data, which our analysis is based on, from the South Park Fandom website <a href="https://southpark.wikia.com">southpark.wikia.com</a>.
                All Fandom sites share an API that makes it easy toretrieve pages in JSON format, thus allowing us to get all the data we needed from the character pages. 
                Much to our luck, the South Park Fandom wikia also has the scripts for each episode in a somewhat unified format, making it easy to
                analyze the scripts themselves. We also found, that it was easy to determine which characters were actually saying each
                line from the script, allowing us to individually analyze each character. Based on the character pages and the links between them we created a network.
                You can see a visualisation of that networkd below.

                <h2>The Network</h2>
                <p>
                    Lets jump into the pool of data and see what we can unravel. Our network consist of 908 nodes, representing the
                    characters and 3931 edges, representing the connections between the characters. Even though we plotted the network in
                    as an undirected graph, to make it beautiful, the network is in fact a directed graph with edges pointing from one node to
                    another. Due to this we can examine what characters that are more connected than others. To get an overview of the
                    network as a whole, lets plot the degree distribution of all the nodes in the network, where degree is summed up as all the edges going
                    in and out from the nodes. 
                </p>

                </p>

                <p> 
                    As we can see, most of the characters have under 10 links, which means most characters in the show only interact with a
                    few characters. There is only a few characters with high degrees. Due to this the network corresponds to something
                    called the power law, which indicates that the network has a hub structure. A hub structure is when a network has a
                    central part, containing one or several nodes, that almost every other node in the network connects to, something that
                    is common in many real world networks. To better visualize this structure we plotted the betweenness centrality of the
                    network, a measurement which makes it possible for us to see which nodes the most information pases trough, that is who
                    has the most control over the network.
                </p>

                </p>

                <p>
                    As we can see, Cartman (red) is the most central character in the show, followed by Stan (blue), Kyle (green) who are
                    quite similar in centrality. Unsurprisingly, the least central main character is Kenny (orange). This is due to Kenny
                    being mostly a gag character, as the audience can only barely hear anything he says due to his muffled speech. This
                    means that the amount of episodes where Kenny is a central character is quite limited in comparison to the other main
                    characters.

                <p> For anyone who has seen more than 5 seconds of South Park I do not think it comes as a surprise that Cartman has his

                <h3>Sentiment</h3>
                <p>
                    Sentiment analysis is a tool to find the positivity or negativity in language. This is done by comparing words
                    in a text to a massive datasheet, with data of the 'average happiness' of words in english. By analysing the text in
                    accordance to this, we can get an impression over which characters are the most positive and negative in the town of
                    South Park. First lets meet the baddies, the people with the worst attitude in South Park. After that we have the goodies, South Parks joyous 
                    little wonders of happiness.

                <p>
                    As we can see, none of the main characters, or even reoccuring side characters, take up any of the extremes of the
                    sentiment ranking. The top 5 most positive and least positive are all occupied by side characters that appear in only a
                    few episodes, if not only one. Due to them having few words relative to the main cast, it makes sense that their
                    sentiment would be more in the extremes while characters with many spoken words would lie more in the middle. It is
                    also often the case for single-episode characters in South Park to represent an extreme of one opinion, so a character
                    would be only negative towards one topic instead of being more nuanced like the reoccuring characters.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Looking only at the four boys, we see that Eric Cartman is actually the most positive of the crew, despite him often
                    advocating for the most morally wrong things. This could be due to the words he's using simply not appearing in the
                    dataset, or that he only says words that are bad in context instead of being negative in and of themselves. Kenny
                    McCormick being the main character with the lowest sentiment is expected, however, as he often says things other
                    characters cannot, such as more intense swears. This is due to his speech being muffled, and as such barely audible for
                    the viewers of the show.
                </p>
                <h3>Catch phrases</h3>
                <p>
                    Now that we've looked at sentiment for both characters and the show as a whole, we wanted to look at what the unique
                    words for the characters to try to see if we could figure out if certain characters have catch phrases. We do this by
                    applying the TF-IDF algorithm, which calculates the Term Frequency (how often a word appears in the text) in relation
                    to the Inverse Document Frequency (how many texts the word appears in).

                    In order to get a better overview of the results, we convert the TF-IDF results into wordclouds. As the four main
                    characters are the most interesting to look at, we decided to only create wordclouds for these. What you see in the wordclouds are
                    the words that are used by the characters more so then for any other character. The bigger the words the more unique is is to the character. 
                    We took the liberty to imagine the catchphrases for the four boys based on their wourdclouds. These are the results:
                </br>
                    <b>Kyle:</b> "Fatass, don't butter my dreidl!"
                    </br>
                    <b>Stan:</b> "Dude, don't look at Wendy!"
                    </br>
                    <b>Kenny:</b> "Woohoo, quack the fuckin' fuck!"
                    </br>
                    <b>Cartman:</b> "Mom, fuck an asshole jew guy!"

                <h2>Seasons</h2>
                <p>
                    Now that we have analysed each of the characters, we thought it would be interesting to look at the sentiment of the
                    show as a whole, bundling the episodes per season. As the show releases a season each year, this will give us insight
                    into how the tone of the show has changed over time, which we can relate to real world events around the same
                    timeframe.
                </p>

                <p>
                    It turns out the most positive seasons are around the beginning and the latest seasons, with the middle being the most
                    negative seasons. Season 22 is an outlier in this, but this could be due to this season only having a few episodes out
                    at the time of writing, and as such has less time to normalize the sentiment like the other seasons.
                    
                    Relating this to the real world, the most negative years would be between seasons 10 and 15, which would correspond to
                    the timeframe 2006-2011. The most negative season is season 11, which aired in 2007. This season contained many
                    episodes with crude subject matters, such as the episode where the boys pretend that they have tourettes syndrome. This
                    adds up to a South Park that is not afraid to use more unconvetional language for comedic effect, and is regarded as
                    one of the best seasons in all of South Park.

                        We can see unique words throughout the seasons that correspond well with what was going on in the world at the time.
                        Around the beginning we can se Manson, referring to Marilyn Manson who was controversial at the time. Later on we see
                        Saddam Hussein appearing, right around when the conflict in Iraq was flaring up. This leads to season 9 where we see
                        the famous Scientology episode dominating the wordcloud. Season 10 we have the Mohammad conflict, which was just after
                        the Muhammad drawing by Jyllands Posten in Denmark, among others. In Season Fifteen we see Wikileaks in the wordcloud,
                        which appeared when South Park did their parody of Julian Assange. In season 18 we start seeing Gluten, Freemium, Drone
                        and Kickstart - all topics that quickly grew in popularity around when the season aired in 2014. Season 19 started with
                        the rise of PC (politically correct) culture, and the massive gentrification movements that took place around the
                        world, which of course was reflected in South Park. This all culminates in Season 22, which is currently airing, with
                        words such as Vape, Anxiety and Amazon appearing, Amazon being especially notable as their poor working conditions have
                        been appearing in the news lately.
